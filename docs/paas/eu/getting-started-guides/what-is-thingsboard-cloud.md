The [**ThingsBoard Cloud**](/products/paas/) is a fully managed, scalable and fault-tolerant platform for your IoT applications.
ThingsBoard Cloud is for everyone who would like to use [ThingsBoard](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}getting-started-guides/what-is-thingsboard/) but don't want to host their own instance of the platform.
As a platform user, you get a [tenant account](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/entities-and-relations/) with certain entity and API [limits](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/tenant-profiles/#entity-limits)
that are defined based on the [subscription plan](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}subscription/).

With **ThingsBoard Cloud** you get the following benefits:

- **Advanced features.** Platform supports all [Professional Edition](/products/thingsboard-pe/) features and advanced [domain management](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}domains/).
- **Improved time to market.** Save time on maintenance of the platform or configuration of the features.
- **Reduced costs.** The cost of the cluster infrastructure is shared between the users of the platform.
- **High availability.** ThingsBoard Cloud uses microservices architecture and is deployed in multiple availability zones.
- **Data durability.** Platform uses data replication and backup procedures to make sure you don't lose the data.

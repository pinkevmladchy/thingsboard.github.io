title: Predict remaining time
description: Guide how to predict remaining time to specific event
---
Trendz introduces a powerful feature for calculating time-to-event using calculated fields and prediction models. This functionality allows users to predict when a specific event is likely to occur based on telemetry data.

## Examples of Use Cases
* **Predict fuel depletion:** Calculate when fuel in a tank will run out.
* **Battery monitoring:** Estimate the time left before a battery is fully discharged.
* **Threshold alerts:** Determine when a monitored parameter will exceed or drop below a critical value.
* **Time-to-Maintenance:** Predict the time remaining until maintenance is required for equipment or machinery.

With this feature, you can proactively manage resources, set up alarms, and take preventive measures to avoid downtime or failures.

To learn more about how to set up and use this feature, refer to our detailed guide: [Calculate time to value](/docs/trendz/calculate-time-to-value).

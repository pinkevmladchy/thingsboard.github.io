You'll need to set up PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS. ThingsBoard will use it as a main database to store devices, dashboards, rule chains and device telemetry.
You may follow [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.PostgreSQL.html) guide,
but take into account the following requirements:

* Keep your postgresql password in a safe place. We will refer to it later in this guide using **YOUR_RDS_PASSWORD**.
* Make sure your PostgreSQL version is latest 16.x;
* Make sure your PostgreSQL RDS instance is accessible from the ThingsBoard cluster;
  The easiest way to achieve this is to deploy the PostgreSQL RDS instance in the same VPC
  and use 'eksctl-thingsboard-cluster-ClusterSharedNodeSecurityGroup-*' security group.
  We assume you locate it in the same VPC in this guide;
* Make sure you use **"thingsboard"** as initial database name. If you do not specify a database name, Amazon RDS does not create a database;

And recommendations:

* Use 'Production' template for high availability. It enables a lot of useful settings by default;
* Use 'Provisioned IOPS' for better performance;
* Consider creation of custom parameters group for your RDS instance. It will make change of DB parameters easier;
* Consider deployment of the RDS instance into private subnets. This way it will be nearly impossible to accidentally expose it to the internet.

Once the database switch to the 'Available' state, navigate to the 'Connectivity and Security' and copy the endpoint value.

Edit "tb-node-db-configmap.yml" and replace **YOUR_RDS_ENDPOINT_URL** and **YOUR_RDS_PASSWORD**.
